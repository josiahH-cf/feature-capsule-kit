This is the generic feature capsule template. Use the `new_feature.sh` script to instantiate a new feature.

Contents:
- `capsule/{{FEATURE_ID}}/` — planning/governance/quality docs for the capsule
- `features/{{FEATURE_ID}}/` — feature workspace (reports, artifacts)

Placeholders are replaced by the engine script:
- {{FEATURE_ID}}
- {{PROJECT_NAMESPACE}}
- {{VERSION}}
- {{UPDATED_DATE}}
